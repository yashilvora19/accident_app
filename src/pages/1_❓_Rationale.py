    Every year, there are over **6,100,000** reported car crashes in the United States. A large number of these car crashes are 
    caused by reckless driving and lack of awareness as to the driving conditions at the time. Our group wanted to contribute to 
    solving this issue, so we decided to design a system to predict the severity of a car crash given specific data about the 
    surroundings.

    By looking at the factors that contribute the most to accidents, we hope to improve road safety and learn from past mistakes through 
    our data to minimize the number of accidents and casualties.

    While our dataset has been collected from incidents of accidents in the UK, we hope to implement it in other cities starting with
    San Diego in in order to improve road safety and save lives!
